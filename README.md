Players take turns making words from a 5x5 board of tiles. Tap letters from anywhere on the board to assemble a word, then tap "SUMBIT" to turn those tiles your color.<br />
When the player makes every tile on the grid of his/her color, then the player wins.

## Word Rules -
Words must have at least two letters. Words may only be played once. Words may not be a prefix of a previously played word. For example, if Player 1 plays the word "QUILTS", Player 2 cannot play "QUILT" (but "QUILTED" and "QUIT" would both be fine). Prefixes are literal, so QUART is a prefix of QUARTZ. And variations of words may be played, e.g. SHORTED after SHORT. No proper nouns (i.e. Capitalized words), abbreviations, or acronyms.

## Defending Tiles - 
You can protect a tile from being stolen by surrounding it with other tiles of the same color. Players may use defended tiles to make a word, but they won't change color. Note that defended tiles aren't permanent, they will become vulnerable if their neighbors change color.

## Ending the Game - 
Your score is the number of tiles that are your color. The game ends when every tile on the board has a color - or - when both players pass their turn in a round. Then the tiles are tallied, and the player with the highest score wins!
