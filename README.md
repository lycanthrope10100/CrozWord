Players alternate creating words from a 5x5 grid of tiles. Select letters anywhere on the board to form a word, then press "SUBMIT" to convert those tiles to your color.<br />
The player who changes all grid tiles to their color wins the game.

## Word Rules:
Words must consist of a minimum of two letters. Each word can be played only once. A word cannot be a prefix of a previously played word. For instance, if Player 1 uses "JUMPS," Player 2 cannot play "JUMP" (however, "JUMPED" and "JUMPING" are acceptable). Prefixes are exact matches, so GUN is a prefix of GUNK. Variations of words can be played, such as SMILED after SMILE. No proper nouns (i.e. Capitalized words), abbreviations, or acronyms are allowed.

## Defending Tiles: 
You can defend a tile from being taken by encircling it with tiles of the same color. Players can utilize defended tiles to form words, but their color won't change. Note that defended tiles aren't permanent; they become vulnerable if neighboring tiles change color.

## Ending the Game:
Your score is determined by the number of tiles in your color. The game ends when all tiles on the board have a color or when both players pass their turn in a round. Scores are tallied then, and the player with the highest score wins!
